        The idea of creating a suicide prevention platform was initially implemented by the fact of suicide being an undoubted reality in the Australian community currently. Thus, suicide prevention training and programs are strongly encouraged by the Australian Health Department in both private and public environments.
       <br>
       <br>
        The project is developed in the hope of bringing more meanings to life by helping young people having a basic understanding about suicide, identify the warning signs and how to start a conversation in order to prevent it or even help themselves.
