          Help Is Not Always Available
        </ion-card-title>
        <p> When professional help is not available, it is possible that non-professional people can start a conversation and take actions cited below (if immediate risk for life is present though, calling emergency is a must):
          </p>
        <p><strong>START A CONVERSATION</strong>, recognising the signs and asking about suicide are the first step to identify a suicide behaviour. Among others, the main noticeable signs are:</p>
        <p>- Deliberately talking about wanting to kill oneself.</p>
        <p>- Talking about suicidal plans.
          </p>
        <p>- Talking about feelings of; hopelessness, trappiness, unbearable pain,  having no reason to live or being a burden to others</p>
        <p>- Increased usage of any kind of drugs (medication, alcohol or other illicit drugs)
          </p>
        <p>- Behaviour changes or extreme mood swings; acting anxious or agitated, behaving recklessly, depression feelings, showing rage or talking about seeking revenge.
          </p>
        <p>- Withdrawing or feeling isolated.

          Be Comfortable
        </ion-card-title>
        <p>If the individual being asked is not comfortable with the conversation and showing signs of distress, appropriate <strong>PROFESSIONAL HELP IS REQUIRED</strong></p>
        <P>Then, it is important to show trustworthiness. A person who is thinking about suicide must feel comfortable when talking about their feelings and that is usually a hard task when both people are not close relatives or friends, it is possible to do so when the one who is asking is able to: Listen + Learn (Explore)</P>
        <p>- Demonstrate interest on the conversation and the factors related to their pain.</p>
        <p>- Do not give solutions, but let them know that they have been heard. 
          </p>
        <p>- Talk things through and try to explore options, make sure that major decisions (unconscious cognition approach to suicide) are not the best option.
          </p>
        <p>- In more extreme cases, acknowledge that suicide may be an option, but it is imperative to say that it is not the only one. Present the idea of putting any major decision (suicide) on hold, and look at ways they could stay safe (the non-suicide contract previously mentioned). This is a important method to take the pressure off one in this stage.

            Start Their Safety Plan
          </ion-card-title>
          <p>When acknowledgment is put out of the way, the next step is to  create a safety plan. It varies from case to case, therefore, it is necessary that both individuals agrees into searching for answers. For example, if the risk factor is aloneness, seek for resolutions, asking for example: do they have support? How alone do they feel? Who can they connect with, and who can help them with this?, and so on.</p>
          <p>- For immediate safety, recognise what needs to be done and in what priority. For example: contacting a psychologist, or disposing materials that can cause harm.
            </p>
          <p>- For future safety, recognise who they may be able to contact when going through a tough situation, who they may seek help from, how they may calm, comfort or distract themselves, setting up a safety limit for alcohol or drugs.

        <p>It is important that the person you are helping get to be around people. Loneliness is one of the risk-factors when it comes to sucide ideation</p>
        <p>If it is not you, ask the person about who they feel comfortable with, or who their trust, and ask more about them and if possible even get their details. It is important that you recommend the person to contact these important people. </p>
