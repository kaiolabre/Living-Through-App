    <h6>Suicide Statitcs</h6>
  </div>  

  <div class="awareness-content" text-wrap>
    <p>
        1. Consider a group of 1,000 people, randomly selected from the world’s population. Each year, four of these people will commit suicide, seven will make plans to kill themselves, and twenty will seriously consider suicide (Borges et al., 2010).
    </p>
    <p>2. Around the world, most epidemiologists agree that suicide statics may be up to 3 times higher than what is actually reported, because of the fact that accidental death such as accidental fall, overdose, or car accidents with certain conditions  may have been caused by a suicide attempt rather than a random accident.</p>
    <p>3. Suicide causes more deaths per year than homicide or HIV/AIDS (Nock, Borges, Bromet, Cha, et al., 2008).</p>
    <p>4. Studies have shown that from people that participated the research, the suicide ideation has been computed at 9.2%; suicide plans were reported among 3.1%; and 2.7% actually attempted suicide during their lifetime (Nock, Borges, Bromet, Alonso, et al., 2008). Suicide is the second leading cause of death among college students, almost 12% had suicide ideation during the past 12 months, where approximately 10% attempt to take their own lives but only a few died (Wilcox et al., 2010). 
      </p>
    <p>4. “It is estimated that two thirds of suicide attempters do not really want to die. Almost a third more are ambivalent or undecided about dying, and only 3 to 5% of suicide cases involve people who are willing to die, and that mostly include people that can only live by the usage of an equipment or in their deathbed.” (Coon, D., Mitterer, J. 2012)</p>

    <h6>Understanding Suicide</h6>
  </div>

  <div class="awareness-content" text-wrap>
    <h4>Altruist Suicide</h4>
    <p>Altruistic suicide is a determined culture condition, such as the ancient custom in Japan called hara-kiri (when a person brings dishonor to themselves or to their family, so he or she is expected to take their own lives with a sword).</p>
    <h4>"Egoistic Suicide"</h4>
    <p>consists of losing social support as the main reason to encourage people to commit suicide. Magne-lngvar, Ojehagen, and Traskman-Bendz (1992) discovered that only 13% of 75 people that had a suicide attempt had a what is considered adequate social network which correspond to a more recent study that showed that suicide attempters had significantly lower social support than did non-attempters (Riihimaki, Vuorilehto, Melartin, Haukka, & Isometsa, 2013). </p>
    <h4>Anomic suicide</h4>
    <p>That is the result of pain marked by disruptions, such as the loss of a job or one’s loved one and finally, fatalistic suicides that are when people lose control of their own destiny, such as someone inducting them to commit suicide.

    <h6>Myths & Facts</h6>
  </div>

  <div class="awareness-content">
    <h6><strong>Myth:</strong></h6>
    <p>"NO ONE CAN STOP A SUICIDE, 
        THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT".</p>
    <h6><strong>Fact:</strong></h6>
    <p>Suicide is one of the most preventable kinds of death, 
        even the simplest positive action can save a life.</p>
    <h6><strong>Myth:</strong></h6>
    <p>"TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE OR ASKING SOMEONE IF THEY 
        FEEL SUICIDAL WILL ENCOURAGE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS."</p>
    <h6><strong>Fact:</strong></h6>
    <p>"Given the widespread stigma around suicide, most people who are contemplating suicide do not know who to speak to. Rather than 
        encouraging suicidal behaviour, talking openly can give an individual other options or the time to rethink his/her decision, thereby preventing suicide."</p>
    <h6><strong>Myth:</strong></h6>
    <p>"SOMEONE WHO IS SUICIDAL IS DETERMINED TO DIE."</p>
    <h6><strong>Fact:</strong></h6>
    <p>"On the contrary, suicidal people are often ambivalent about living or dying. Someone may act impulsively by drinking pesticides, for instance, and die a few days later, 
      even though they would have liked to live on. Access to emotional support at the right time can prevent suicide."</p>
    <h6><strong>Myth:</strong></h6>
    <p>"MOST SUICIDES HAPPEN WITHOUT WARNING."</p>
    <h6><strong>Fact:</strong></h6>
    <p>"The majority of suicides have been preceded by warning signs, whether verbal or behavioural. Of course there are some suicides that occur without warning. 
        But it is important to understand what the warning signs are and look out for them."</p>
    <h6><strong>Myth:</strong></h6>
    <p>ONLY PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE SUICIDAL"</p>
    <h6><strong>Fact:</strong></h6>
    <p>"Suicidal behaviour indicates deep unhappiness but not necessarily mental disorder. Many people living with mental disorders are not affected by suicidal behaviour, and not all people who take their own lives have a mental disorder."</p>
    <h6><strong>Myth:</strong></h6>
    <p>"PEOPLE WHO TALK ABOUT SUICIDE ARE NOT ALWAYS INTENDING TO TAKE THEIR OWN LIFE."</p>
    <h6><strong>Fact:</strong></h6>
    <p>"People who talk about suicide may be reaching out for help or support. A significant number of people contemplating suicide 
        are experiencing anxiety, depression and hopelessness and may feel that there is no other option."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="featured">
    <h6>Suicide Risk Factors</h6>
  </div>

  <div class="awareness-content">
    <h4>Family History</h4>
    <p>-  The risks of someone taking their own life is increased if they have someone in their family who committed suicide (Brent et al., 2015; Mann et al., 2005; Nock et al., 2011). </p>
    <p>-  Suicidal behaviours were stronger on patients who had depression and also had a family history of suicide(Hantouche et al., 2010).  </p>
    <p>-  Family history may not be surprising because people who commit suicide had a predisposition to a mental disorders, but mental disorders run in families. Suicidal behaviours is not proved to be a genetic disease, but many adoption studies support this idea (Nock et al., 2011). 
      </p>

    <h4>Neurobiology</h4>
    <p>Serotonin may be associated with suicide and suicide attempts as when it occurs to be in extremely low levels, it can be associated with impulsivity, instability, and overreactions. It is possible that this condition may contribute to impulsive acts, including killing oneself, which is in some cases an impulsive act. (Pompili et al., 2010; Asberg, Nordstrom, & Traskman-Bendz, 1986; Cremniter et al., 1999; Winchel, Stanley, & Stanley, 1990).</p>
    
    <h4>Existing Psychological Disorders</h4>
    <p>More than 80% of people who kill themselves suffer from a psychological disorder, usually mood, substance use, or impulse control disorders (Berman, 2009; Brent & Kolko, 1990; Conwell et al., 1996; Joe, Baser, Breeden, Neighbors, & Jackson, 2006; Nock, Hwang, Sampson, & Kessler, 2009). However, depression and suicide, although strongly related, are still independent.</p>
    
    <h4>Other Psychological Disorders</h4>
    <p>- Hopelessness as a primary factor of suicide when the individual is not depressed, the “interpersonal theory of suicide” cites that a perception of oneself as a burden on others and a diminished sense of belonging as powerful predictors of hopelessness and subsequently suicide (van Orden et al., 2010).</p>
    <p>- Combinations of disorders, such as substance abuse and mood disorders,  seem to be a stronger risk factor than any other by itself (Conwell et al., 1996; Nock, Hwang, et al., 2010; Woods et al., 1997). </p>
    <p>- Past suicide attempts are another strong risk factor. And also, borderline personality disorder is when individuals make manipulative or impulsive suicidal gesture, they are know to do it without the intention to actually harm themselves, but in 10% of the cases they end up actually killing themselves by mistake.</p>

    <h4>Stressful Life Events</h4>
    <p>
        - Shame or humiliation: failure (real or imagined) in school or at work, an unexpected arrest, or a rejection by a loved one.
    </p>
    <p>- Physical and sexual assault.</p>
    <p>- Natural disasters increase the likelihood of an suicide attempt, particularly in the case of a catastrophes (Matsubayashi, Sawada, & Ueda, 2012).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="featured">
    <h6>Suicide Prevention</h6>
  </div>

  <div class="awareness-content">
    <p>Despite the identification of the risk factors mentioned above, there are still many barriers when it comes to predicting suicide. There are reports about individuals that had few precipitating factors or even none of them and they still unexpectedly take their own lives, and there are those who presented every sign of suicidal thoughts or were in fact under the circumstances cited above, and little social support of or guidance but they still find a way to resist and overcome their difficulties.</p>
    <p>Professionals are trained to check for possible event of recent humiliation or personal feeling of failure or shame in order to determine if one’s indicate the possibility of suicide ideation, plans or even attempts. In summary, they ask for:
    </p>
    <p>- Suicidal desire. It includes checking for risk factors, suicide ideation, hopelessness, burdensomeness, feelings of being trapped or even wanting the pain to suddenly stop</p>
    <p>- Capability of suicide, such as past attempts, anxiety or rage levels or available means.</p>
    <p>- Suicide intention. It is imperative to seek for plans, if existent, expressed intent to die, preparatory behaviour (e.g. valued material donation or conversations about after death wills). </p>
    
    <h4>Prevention</h4>
    <p>It first starts from the very beginning where people have zero suicide ideation or thoughts of suicide. In this case, individuals are not usually concerned about suicide and how it may impact their lives, and some even disconsider the possibility that someone in their daily basis activity is going through a tough time. Therefore, rising awareness about mental health and the existence of suicide risks and how to prevent it are the very first steps to provide information for those that may need if or when their time comes, either going through suicide ideation themselves or helping someone not to consider suicide as an option. </p>
    <p>Nevertheless, approaches to resolving life events and professional help for those with psychological disorders are also very important for those who need it, and awareness is an important tool to commove society in order to motivate those individuals understand that it is ok and essential to seek and provide help when needed.</p>
    
  </div>
  
  <div class="featured">
    <h6>Suicide Intervention</h6>
  </div>

  <div class="awareness-content">
    <p>Regardless of the risk-factors that lead somebody into this stage, suicide ideation is the first step into this dangerous path, where an individual might consider suicide as an option to resolving their current situation, but it is difficult to share or identify these thoughts, people tend to not share these feelings mostly because they are afraid of somehow being judged or ignored. This is where suicide awareness is most efficient on the fight against suicide.</p>
    <p>Although, if nothing happens, and the risk-factors are still present, it is likely that these people start considering the way that they would possibly do it such as jumping off a bridge or even shooting themselves, regardless of the method considered, this phase is called the planning stage. Here, the signs are not 100% clear, but the suicide contemplation is present, professional help is a must, and if not available, social support like starting a conversation is essential to prevent them to go to the next stage: preparation. 
      </p>
    <p>However, there are cases that the individuals involved have a lack of social support, or it is inefficient, either way in the preparation stage, individuals start to prepare for his or her own death, for example: purchasing a gun or a rope, making a statement or preparing their will after death or leaving a note. Disregarding the neurobiology risk factor mentioned above, where individuals may skip the planning and preparation stages and in an impulsive act unexpectedly take their own lives, the preparing stage leads to a suicidal behaviour. </p>
    <p>An individual in this stage is likely to take their own lives in a very short period of time and most of them tent to give clear signs of suicide intentions that will be later discussed on this document. It is imperative that these signs can be recognised. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="featured">
    <h6>Professional Help is NOT Always Available</h6>
  </div>

  <div class="awareness-content">
    <p> When professional help is not available, it is possible that non-professional people can start a conversation and take actions cited below (if immediate risk for life is present though, calling emergency is a must):
      </p>
    <p><strong>START A CONVERSATION</strong>, recognising the signs and asking about suicide are the first step to identify a suicide behaviour. Among others, the main noticeable signs are:</p>
    <p>- Deliberately talking about wanting to kill oneself.</p>
    <p>- Talking about suicidal plans.
      </p>
    <p>- Talking about feelings of; hopelessness, trappiness, unbearable pain,  having no reason to live or being a burden to others</p>
    <p>- Increased usage of any kind of drugs (medication, alcohol or other illicit drugs)
      </p>
    <p>- Behaviour changes or extreme mood swings; acting anxious or agitated, behaving recklessly, depression feelings, showing rage or talking about seeking revenge.
      </p>
    <p>- Withdrawing or feeling isolated.
      </p>
    <p>If the individual being asked is not comfortable with the conversation and showing signs of distress, appropriate <strong>PROFESSIONAL HELP IS REQUIRED</strong></p>
    <P>Then, it is important to show trustworthiness. A person who is thinking about suicide must feel comfortable when talking about their feelings and that is usually a hard task when both people are not close relatives or friends, it is possible to do so when the one who is asking is able to: Listen + Learn (Explore)</P>
    <p>- Demonstrate interest on the conversation and the factors related to their pain.</p>
    <p>- Do not give solutions, but let them know that they have been heard. 
      </p>
    <p>- Talk things through and try to explore options, make sure that major decisions (unconscious cognition approach to suicide) are not the best option.
      </p>
    <p>- In more extreme cases, acknowledge that suicide may be an option, but it is imperative to say that it is not the only one. Present the idea of putting any major decision (suicide) on hold, and look at ways they could stay safe (the non-suicide contract previously mentioned). This is a important method to take the pressure off one in this stage. 
      </p>
    <p>When acknowledgment is put out of the way, the next step is to  create a safety plan. It varies from case to case, therefore, it is necessary that both individuals agrees into searching for answers. For example, if the risk factor is aloneness, seek for resolutions, asking for example: do they have support? How alone do they feel? Who can they connect with, and who can help them with this?, and so on.</p>
    <p>- For immediate safety, recognise what needs to be done and in what priority. For example: contacting a psychologist, or disposing materials that can cause harm.
      </p>
    <p>- For future safety, recognise who they may be able to contact when going through a tough situation, who they may seek help from, how they may calm, comfort or distract themselves, setting up a safety limit for alcohol or drugs.
      </p>

    <h6>Postvention</h6>
  </div>

  <div class="awareness-content">
    <p>There are still suicide prevention methods even when the suicide attempt has already happened, as discussed before (page 10), people who survive after trying to take their own life is six times more likely to try again.</p>
    <p>When the attempter survives, depending on the method they chose, there is a need to have medical assistant from an injury and that requires time, and money. It may also leave permanent sequels, consequently, it changes the reality of the individual and all people involved (family and friends) and that tend to be an additive to the suicide risk factors. In these cases, it is recommended that attempters are referred to professional help. </p>
    <p>When it comes to a suicide attempt, it is estimated that, not only the attempter but at least six people are affected by an attempt, regardless the individual’s survival or not (Support for families, Whanau and significant others after a suicide attempt, Dr A. L. Beautrais April 2004).
      </p>
    <p>There are several international studies that consider suicide and being a ‘contagious’ event: people react with sadness and curiosity to suicide news, in the other hand, there are some that react by making an attempt themselves, often by the same method. It has been reported that the suicide attempts increase in a 9-day period after new about suicide. Copying a suicide seems to be predominant among teenagers, about 5% of all teenage suicides are reported as an imitation (Gould, 1990; Gould, Greenberg, Velting & Shaffer 2003). Therefore, family and school direct suicide prevention programs and cognitive counselling  are greatly supported in order to prevent people from following the same tragic path.
